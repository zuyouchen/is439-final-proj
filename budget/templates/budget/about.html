    <h3>What is EZ Budget App?</h3>
    <p>
        This simple web application is an online budgeting <b>proof of concept</b>.
        In theory, as a financial planning business, you'd want to manage your advisors, clients, their budgets, incomes, and expenses in a single application.
        Additionally, as a client, you could login and view your budgeting information relatively easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application currently just allows for superusers to perform CRUD operations on all objects.
        Eventually, the application could transition to a more complex authorization scheme where individual users have access
        to their information, advisors have access to their respective clients, and administrators have access to all.
