    <h3>What is EZ Budget App?</h3>
    <p>
        This simple web application is an online budgeting <b>proof of concept</b>.
        In theory, as a financial planning business, you'd want to manage your advisors, clients, their budgets, incomes, and expenses in a single application.
        Additionally, as a client, you could log in and view your budgeting information relatively easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application currently just allows for superusers to perform CRUD operations on all fully supported model objects (Advisor, Client, Budget, Income, Expense, BudgetCategory).
        Some pre-populated object models are not editable aside from the django-admin application (ExpenseCategory, IncomeCategory, and Frequency).
        This is intended and due to the fact that these are realistically static, determined by the financial planning business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually, the application could transition to a more complex authorization scheme where individual users have access
        to their information, advisors have access to their respective clients, and administrators have access to all. This could be easily
        implemented given the existing code checking for permissions.

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>
        Select any of the header buttons above to <b>view lists</b> of the respective objects. <br><br>
        Selecting an item from the list views sends you to a <b>detailed page</b>, containing related information of that particular object. <br><br>
        Detailed pages list object attributes alongside buttons to <b>update</b> or <b>delete</b> the object.
        <br><br>
        Budgets are broken down into separate Budget Categories, which can <i>only</i> be created and updated given an existing Budget.
        <br><br>

        <mark>[WIP]</mark> Selecting a filter by button from the list view sends you to a filtering page, where you can filter by category, frequency, etc.
        <br>
        <mark>[WIP]</mark> Selecting a "generate visualization" button from the list view sends you to a page that generates a visualization of budget/incomes/expenses
